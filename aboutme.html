<h1 style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:20px;"><b>Biography</b></h1>
<p style="font-family:Century Gothic;font-size:15px;">I am Korean-American, and often, because of my ethinicity, racial prejudices
 create disadvantages for me. As an Asian woman, many assume that I am passive and submissive, and because of that,
 I am constantly trying to prove myself. This time spent trying to convince others that I am a candidate worthy of
 being recognized results in time wasted. Instead I could be making improvements and advancements to human rights and
 reshaping the way women are viewed.</p>
<p style="font-family:Century Gothic;font-size:15px">I enjoy eating new things. In fact, I have even tried escargot! I am ambitious
 in the things I want to achieve and I am always looking forward to the future. I am confident in the advancement of women's rights
 because I, along with my peers, are striving to break those social barriers. In the history of the United States, with every advancement
 for the country, women have spoken out, demanding for representation alongside the men of the nation. The taking down of the traditional
 domestic sphere was one of the first large advancements, and resulted in more progress regarding women's rights.</p>
<p style="font-size:25px;">I hope that I can be a pioneer for women's rights and a role model for girls all over the world. </p>
