<h1 style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:20px">Biography</h1>
<p style="font-family:Century Gothic;">I am Korean-American, and often, because of my ethinicity, racial prejudices create disadvantages for me. As an Asian woman, many assume that I am passive and submissive, and because of that, I am constantly trying to prove myself.</p>
<p style="font-family:Century Gothic;">I enjoy eating new things. In fact, I have even tried escargot!</p>
<p>I hope that I can be a pioneer and a role model for girls all over the world.
