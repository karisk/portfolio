<h1 style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:20px">Biography</h1>
<p style="font-family:Century Gothic;">I am Korean-American, and often, because of my ethinicity, racial prejudices
 create disadvantages for me. As an Asian woman, many assume that I am passive and submissive, and because of that,
 I am constantly trying to prove myself. This time spent trying to convince others that I am a candidate worthy of
 being recognized results in time wasted. Instead I could be making improvements and advancements to human rights and
 reshaping the way women are viewed.</p>
<p style="font-family:Century Gothic;">I enjoy eating new things. In fact, I have even tried escargot!</p>
<p>I hope that I can be a pioneer and a role model for girls all over the world. </p>
